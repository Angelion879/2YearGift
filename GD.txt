Basic concepts:

1- a level per phrase

It all started with a brick (1)
And my face (2)
And the idea that both would colide one day (3)
For the joke that your hand would never reach my head (4)
and some other things I said that never made sense (5)
turns out I was wrong (6)
and the whole you made it to my brain (7)

and now we are here (8)
together, after two whole years (9)
I love you, with all my heart... (10)
and soul :P (11)
And I hope that someday (12)
we share our last names (13)
and a place (14)
just for me and you (15)

... and cats <3

##LAST PHRASE == NO LEVEL ONLY THE END, IT TAKES THE PLAYER TO THE MAIN MENU##
Congrats for us, my dear

(NOW STARTS THE REAL DEAL GDD)

GDD - LOVER'S BREAKOUT
(a romantic gift game concept)

[introduction]:
    This document objective is to present and specify technical and artistic concepts of the game "Lover's BreakOut". 
    It contains the narrative behind each part, the game mechanics, gameplay aspects and its objective.

[Inspirations]:
    + BreakOut (ATARI - 1976)
    + My brain
    + You (Luisa)
    + My incredible capacity of being gay

[Summary]:
    After two(2) whole years, here we are. Still together, somehow alive, and surprisingly in love still. 
    Well, at least I am ridiculously in love and do believe that you are as well.
    We've come pretty far, my dear, and I'd like to give you a little of what we both excel in: video games.
    I hope that even if we aren't able to meet in person for our anniversary,
    this piece of entertainment may brighten your day and bring a smile to your face.

[Story]:
    Our story is too long for me to write it down on an editor that doesn’t even know how to break lines.
    [Insert here a big descriptive text explaining our history and everything we’ve been through.]

[Gameplay]:
    Each level has been designed to fit with the concept of a phrase.
    + Level One: is composed of only one brick to represent the brick quoted in the first strophe;

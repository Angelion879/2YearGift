Basic concepts:

1- a level per phrase

It all started with a brick
And my face
And the idea that both would colide one day
For the joke
That your hand would never reach my head
and some other things I said that never made sense
turns out I was wrong
and the whole you made it to my brain

and now we are here
together, after two whole years
I love you, with all my heart...
and soul :P
And I hope that someday
we share our last names
and a place
just for me and you

... and cats <3

##LAST PHRASE == NO LEVEL ONLY THE END, IT TAKES THE PLAYER TO THE MAIN MENU##
Congrats for us, my dear
